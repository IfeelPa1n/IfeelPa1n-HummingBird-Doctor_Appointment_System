IF your wondering the sending of Gmail Sending isn't working
First go to google.com and type LESS SECURE APPS
click this "Less secure apps & your Google Account"
or "myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps" and turn it off to make it work if not 



try doing the following:

Check Spam/Junk Folder:
Sometimes, emails may be classified as spam. Check your spam/junk folder in the recipient's Gmail account.

Correct Email Addresses:
Double-check that the sender and recipient email addresses are correct. Ensure there are no typos or mistakes in the addresses.

Gmail Security Settings:
Ensure that your Gmail account allows access from less secure apps. You may need to enable "Allow less secure apps" in your 
Gmail account settings. Note that this is not recommended for accounts with sensitive information.

App Password (if 2-Step Verification is enabled):
If you have 2-Step Verification enabled on your Gmail account, generate an 
"App Password" and use it in your Java application instead of your regular Gmail password.

Check for Exceptions:
If your Java application encounters an exception while sending the email, 
it might print the stack trace. Check the console or logs for any error messages that 
might provide more information about the issue.

SMTP Server Connection:
Ensure that your computer has a stable internet connection
and can connect to the Gmail SMTP server on port 587.

Firewall/Antivirus Software:
Check if your firewall or antivirus software is blocking the connection to the SMTP server. 
Temporarily disable the firewall or antivirus and try sending the email again.
