This Doctor Appointment System is unique I did not use MySql nor phpmyadmin, I sololy relied on DataMapping and Hashmapping with different JavaClasses that exsist in one package with its
access modifiers (public).
this was my most key points
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

with the use of static array string it made me releaze how imaginative I can become, I basically made my own pre-built database capable of storing data using Keycomponents as access keys
I hope this helps your projects if your a student or a profession, 

Always think outside of the box, Don't give up and most of all always take rest don't push yourself
